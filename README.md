# osx-keyboard-hint
This is a Qt based "keyboard hint" application. I made this app to help myself learning "touch typing", i.e. typing text without looking at the keyboard.

The app consists of a single window with a keyboard layout. Keys are colored by groups, each group corresponds to a finger that one would use to press a key. While running the window always stays on top of other opened windows.

The is a top idea is to keep this app always opened on top of other apps, to use it as a hint while typing text. Thus one can use it to check which finger should be used to press certain key.

I compiled and tested the app only on OS X 10.11, but it could be easily ported to other platforms since it's Qt based.
